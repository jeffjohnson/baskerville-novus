Baskerville Novus Fonts
===

Baskerville Novus is an open source project aimed at creating a high quality Baskerville reproduction based mostly on ATF specimens. It has a slightly taller x-height and bolder stems in order to be legible at smaller sizes and particularly in print.

Initially, the focus of Baskerville Novus will be to create Latin character sets, but will eventually expand to addtional languages in the future.
